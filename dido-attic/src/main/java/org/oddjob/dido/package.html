	<p>Provide a framework for Data Input and Data Output.</p>

	<p>The starting point for reading and writing data is a {@link Layout}.	
	</p>
	
	<h3>Reading Data</h3>
	
	<p>When reading data the typical pattern is:
	
	<ol>
	<li>Use {@link Layout#bind} to bind a {@link Binding} for creating 
	Objects from the data.</li> 
	<li>Use {@link Layout#readerFor} to create a {@link DataReader} from
	some {@link DataIn}.
	<li>Call {@link DataReader#read} continually to read object from the
	data until null indicates there are no more objects to be read.
	</ol>

	<p>The sequence of events is: {@link DataIn} is read into 
	{@link ValueNode} if the {@code Layout is such}. If the {@code Layout} 
	is bound, this is passed to the binding.
	</p>
	
	<p>To be continued...</p>
